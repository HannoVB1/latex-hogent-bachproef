This bachelor’s thesis was written during the 2024–2025 academic year at HoGent. It marks the final stage of my studies and gave me the opportunity to further explore my interest in financial markets and machine learning.

I genuinely enjoyed working on this project. One of the most challenging aspects was interpreting results that did not align with my initial expectations. These moments turned out to be the most rewarding, pushing me to think critically and deepening my understanding of predictive modeling in the context of cryptocurrency.

I would like to thank my promotor, Thomas Desmedt, for his guidance and support throughout this process. His feedback helped refine my research question and topic and provided valuable direction during the writing of this thesis.

I also want to thank a fellow student, Thibo Haezaert, for helping me stay motivated throughout the writing process. His support made a real difference.
